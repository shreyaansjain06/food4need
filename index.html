        <h2>Food Insecurity in the United States</h2>
        <p>Food security is a measure of a household's ability to provide adequate food that is nutritionally valuable
          and sufficient. During 2020,10.5% (13.8 million) of U.S households were food insecure,meaning the quality and
          desirability of the food provided decreased. 3.9% (5.1) million U.S. households had very low food security
          indicating disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake. Due to the hardships of Covid, an already
          difficult and urgent issue became more dire. Families that were living paycheck to paycheck are most at
          risk and many faced employment complications due to the pandemic. Food insecurity rates are the highest
          for single mothers and families below the poverty line.

          <p>Food Waste refers to food that completes the food supply chain to the finished product but does not get
            purchased.
            In 2010, 133 billion pounds of food was wasted, with 31% being lost at the retail and consumer level. In a
            year
            each
            restaurant can be expected to lose between 25,000 and 75,000 pounds of food. Oftentimes, restaurants will
            throw
            away
            food that is ordered but not picked up, along with food that is created but not purchased.

            <h2>How does waste contribute to climate change?</h2>
            <p>When organic waste decomposes, carbon dioxide and methane gas is created.<>
                Methane is created when there is no air present while carbon dioxide is the natural product when
                anything rots
                in air.
                Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming and climate
                change.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p> Food4Need is a service that connects food insecure families with restaurants for the purpose of
              providing nutritional meals to the families and decreasing food waste that occurs in restaurants. This is
              done
              by creating a website where donors can create postings regarding excessive meals providing their company
              name,
              location, and description of meal. The meal postings from various restaurants are then visible to the
              recipients
              who in turn reserve individual meals and proceed to pick it up. This includes but is not limited to food
              that was
              ordered online but not picked up by the customer and meals that were cooked, but not purchased by any
              consumer.
